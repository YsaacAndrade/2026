#  2026 – Daily Projects

---

## 🇺🇸 EN-US

Throughout **2026**, I aim to build **one project per day**.

The difficulty and complexity of the projects will increase progressively as I improve my skills and explore new concepts.

Some projects may require more than one day to complete.  
In those cases, the project will be divided into smaller parts, with each part representing a **daily milestone**.

Although **Python** will be my primary language, I also plan to explore others:
- **Java**, to deepen my understanding of object-oriented programming and because I enjoy its syntax  
- **C**, to gain a stronger foundation in low-level concepts such as memory management and compilation  

This repository serves as a record of continuous practice, learning, and technical growth.

If you would like to collaborate, contribute ideas, or provide feedback, feel free to reach out.

## 🇧🇷 PT-BR

Ao longo de **2026**, meu objetivo é desenvolver **um projeto por dia**.

A dificuldade e a complexidade dos projetos aumentarão progressivamente conforme eu evoluir tecnicamente e explorar novos conceitos.

Alguns projetos podem exigir mais de um dia para serem concluídos.  
Nesses casos, o projeto será dividido em partes menores, onde cada parte representará um **objetivo diário**.

Embora **Python** seja minha linguagem principal, também pretendo explorar outras:
- **Java**, para aprofundar meus conhecimentos em programação orientada a objetos e por gostar da sua sintaxe  
- **C**, com o objetivo de obter uma base mais sólida em conceitos de baixo nível, como gerenciamento de memória e compilação  

Este repositório funciona como um registro de prática contínua, aprendizado e evolução técnica.

Caso queira colaborar, sugerir ideias ou fornecer feedback, sinta-se à vontade para entrar em contato.

### PROGRESS LOG

**Day 1** — Word program that takes user input, counts the number of characters, and checks whether the word is a palindrome.  
*Difficulty: 1/10*

**Day 2** — Program that calculates the famous E = mc², where the user provides the mass.  
*Difficulty: 1/10*

**Day 3** — Math game with three difficulty levels, ten questions, and a maximum of three errors.  
*Difficulty: 5/10*

**Day 4** — A calculator that accepts the operators **+**, **-**, **/**, **x**, and **\*\***.  
*Difficulty: 4/10*

**Day 5** — A Python program that accepts a float or integer USD amount via CLI and returns its Bitcoin value using a real-time API.  
*Difficulty: 6/10*

**Day 6** — A Python game that simulates the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game.  
*Difficulty: 2/10*

**Day 7** — A Python CLI program that validates password strength based on length and character diversity (Part 1).  
*Difficulty: 5/10*

**Day 8** — A Python command-line application that consumes a real-world game pricing API, validates and normalizes user input, distinguishes between games and DLCs, and extracts real-time pricing data to display the lowest available price, the regular price, and a direct link to the store page offering the deal.  
*Difficulty: 8.5/10*

**Day 9** — A Python CLI program that fetches real-time weather data from an external API, validates user input, and displays temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit.  
*Difficulty: 6/10*

**Day 10** — A C program that prompts the user for a height between 1 and 8 and prints a double pyramid using `#`, inspired by the CS50 Mario problem. (1st C code)  
*Difficulty: 7.5/10*

**Day 11** — A Python CLI guessing game where the program generates a random number between 0 and 100 and the user has 5 attempts to guess it correctly.  
*Difficulty: 1/10*

**Day 12** — Enhancement to the Python CLI weather app: added maximum and minimum temperature readings (°C and °F) alongside the current temperature using the OpenWeather API.  
*Difficulty: 1/10*

**Day 13** — **Day 13** — A C program that calculates the minimum number of coins needed to give change using U.S. denominations (25¢, 10¢, 5¢, 1¢). The program validates user input, repeatedly subtracts the largest possible coin value, and counts the total number of coins required until the change reaches zero.  
*Difficulty: 5/10*

**Day 14** — A Python CLI program that simulates a food ordering system using a predefined menu and prices. The program continuously accepts user input, normalizes item names, accumulates the total cost, and displays the running total formatted as currency until the input is terminated.  
*Difficulty: 2/10* 

**Day 15** — A Python CLI program that simulates a Coke vending machine. The user inserts coins (5, 10, or 25 cents) until the total cost of 50 cents is paid. The program continuously displays the remaining amount due and, once paid, returns the correct change if the user overpays.  
*Difficulty: 0/10*

**Day 16** — A Python CLI tool that validates an email address using an external validation library, safely handles invalid input, and extracts the username and domain from a valid email.  
*Difficulty: 1/10*

**Day 17** — A Python class that simulates a cookie jar with limited capacity.  
*Difficulty: 2/10*

**Day 18** — A Python script based on a CS50 lesson that generates a personalized PDF certificate using user input and an image.  
*Difficulty: 3/10*

**Day 19** — A Python script based on a CS50 lesson that validates whether a string is a valid IPv4 address.  
*Difficulty: 1/10*

**Day 20** — A Python script based on a CS50 lesson that calculates the number of minutes since a given birth date and expresses the result in words.  
*Difficulty: 4/10*

**Day 21** — A Python script based on a CS50 lesson that converts time ranges from 12-hour AM/PM format to 24-hour format.  
*Difficulty: 5/10*

**Day 22** — A Python script based on a CS50 lesson that accepts user-input to act like a supermarket-list.  
*Difficulty: 1.2/10*

**Day 23** — A Python program that prompts the user for a GitHub username, fetches their public activity using the GitHub Events API, and displays the most recent event and repository. This is the first part of a larger project that will be expanded over time.  
*Difficulty: 1/10*

**Day 24** — A Python script based on a CS50 lesson that reads a CSV file from the command line and displays its contents as a formatted table.  
*Difficulty: 3/10*

**Day 25** — A Python script based on a CS50 lesson that renders user input as ASCII art using pyfiglet, with optional font selection via command-line arguments.  
*Difficulty: 0/10 (Sunday mode)*
