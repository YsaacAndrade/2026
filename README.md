# 2026 – Daily Projects

Throughout 2026, I aim to build one project per day.
The difficulty and complexity of the projects will increase over time.

Some projects may take more than one day to complete.
In those cases, I will break them into smaller parts, with each part representing a daily goal.

Although Python will be my main language, I also plan to explore other languages.
I want to learn Java because I enjoy its syntax, and I plan to use C to gain a deeper understanding of low-level concepts.

If you want to help, collaborate, or suggest ideas, feel free to reach out!
